Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations is a project designed to automate and optimize the process of assigning support tickets within an organization. In traditional systems, tickets are often assigned manually, leading to delays, workload imbalance, and reduced efficiency. This project introduces an intelligent system that analyzes ticket priority, category, agent skills, and current workload before automatically assigning the ticket to the most suitable support agent. By using rule-based logic and machine learning techniques, the system ensures faster response times, balanced task distribution, and improved customer satisfaction. Overall, it enhances operational efficiency and minimizes human errors in support management.
